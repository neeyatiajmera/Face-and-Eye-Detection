# Face-and-Eye-Detection
Face and eye detection python program using OpenCV

This Project utilizes OpenCV to build a face and eye detection program. It's primarily used to track faces in a live video. The objective of this Python project is to learn about OpenCV. OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. 

OpenCV comes with many pre-trained classifiers. I have used the haarcascade_frontalface as well as haarcascade_eye classifiers that come as a xml file. A face cascade and an eye cascade are created using that classifiers
This program uses the webcam as the video source in order to detect faces and eyes. Upon detection, it draws a green rectangle around it.

#How to Run this project
Download the entire project folder and extract all files in the folder. Run the .py file and ensure that the xml files are in the same folder as the .py file.
Another window would open up and this is how the detection would look like


#How to exit the program
Press the ‘q’ key on your keyboard to stop the program from running.
